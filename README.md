Dates:

The project was started January 25th and was completed February 12th with an 
estimated 80 hours of work in the project.

Project Roles:
===
Timmy was in charge of the interface and front end of the project. Meanwhile,
Salo and Tim where in charge of the simulations and refactoring.


How to use the program:
===
To use the program, one has to run the simulation and open the XML file for the
simulation one wants to use. Once opened the simulation, then one can use key 
inputs found on the top right corner. One can Open, Do a New simulation, 
Save or SaveAs the file. With respect to the simulation, one can use either the 
hot keys or click to do each task wanted. However, one must know that speed up 
has a maximum cap in which one can speed the simulation. Secondly, one can't 
reverse the simulation or seek if the timeline is paused. In view, one can 
change the simulation color, zoom in and zoom out. In addition, some interesting
examples of data files can be found in the data folder

Extra Features included:
==
4 more simulations were included. These are Foraging Ants, LangtonsLoop,
SlimeMold and SugarScape. In addition, one can change the shape and zoom in and 
out in the simulation, reverse and seek which step one wants. and open to make 
a new simulation to visualize various simulations at once.
