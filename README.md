Dates:
======
The project was started January 25th and was completed February 12th with an 
estimated 80 hours of work in the project.

Project Roles:
===
Timmy was in charge of the XML formatting and parsing, interface and front end and backend design of the project. Meanwhile,
Salo and Tim where in charge of the Fire, SugarScape, SlimeMold, Foraging Ants, and Langton's Loop simulations.


How to use the program:
===
To use the program, one has to run the simulation and open the XML file for the
simulation one wants to use. Once opened the simulation, then one can use key 
inputs found on the top right corner. One can Open, Do a New simulation, 
Save or SaveAs the file. With respect to the simulation, one can use either the 
hot keys or click to do each task wanted. However, one must know that speed up 
has a maximum cap in which one can speed the simulation. Secondly, one can't 
reverse the simulation or seek if the timeline is paused. In view, one can 
change the simulation color, zoom in and zoom out. In addition, some interesting
examples of data files can be found in the data folder.

Extra Features included:
==
* Colors can be changed through hue, saturation, and lightness
* The simulation can be zoomed and panned.
* The simulation cell frequencies are recorded and graphed over time
* The simulation can be sped up, slowed down, reversed, paused, and seeked.
* Color of the cell outlines can be set in the xml file, or left blank
* Opening new XML files
* Saving simulation to PNG
* Saving simulation to XML
* Opening multiple simulation simultaneously
* 3 shapes can be chosen through the XML file (Square, Hexagon, Triangle)
* 3 ways of getting neighbors can be chosen through the XML file (All neighbors, adjacent neighbors only, corners only)
* 2 types of bounds can be chosen through the XML file (Finite, Toroidal)
* Supports specifying initial conditions by individual cell, row, column, or entire grid
* Supports specifying random initial state 
* 1 Additional Simulation in SugarScape
* This file can be opened on Gitlab with F1, or through the menu
* Menu items can be accessed through default hotkeys in both Mac and Windows.
* Run Length Encoded Game Of Life File (RLE) to XML converter included as a Perl script

Human resources used to develop the project
==
Some of the human resources used for the project was StackOverflow and the
resources used for this Project where the ones used for the rules give by 
Professor Robert Duvall.

Resource file
===
The resource file neeeded for this project should be in an XML format that must
have certain information about each cell for each simulation.

Test files used
==
Some of the test files used for this program can be found in the data folder 
where various of the simulations XML files can be found.

Files used to start the project
==
The only file needed to start the project is the XML file that has the 
information about the cells and the positions which one must input for the
simulation to start.
